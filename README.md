## 👋 About Me

Hi! I'm Raisa, an engineering student at Thadomal Shahani Engineering College, Mumbai University (Class of 2027), majoring in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. I'm passionate about building real-world solutions that blend AI, data, and finance—especially those that can empower individuals or communities through innovation.

I enjoy tackling complex problems, whether it’s simulating portfolio risk using Monte Carlo techniques or developing optimization models to assess uncertainty in decision-making. I also care deeply about inclusive tech education and have been involved in outreach initiatives like Project Ujala.
